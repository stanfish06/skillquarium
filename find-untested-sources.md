# find-untested-sources

> [!info] What it does
> Parse-only static analysis that pairs source files with the tests referencing them and emits JSON listing untested files ordered by API surface, each with a suggested_test_path. Roslyn engine for C#/.NET (namespace-aware), tree-sitter engine for polyglot repos (Python, TS/JS, Go, Java, Rust, Ruby). USE FOR: where to write tests next, which files have no tests, find untested code, build a source-to-test pairing map, prioritized test-gap worklist. DO NOT USE FOR: line/branch coverage or CRAP risk (use coverage-analysis); whether existing tests are strong (use test-gap-analysis or assertion-quality).
