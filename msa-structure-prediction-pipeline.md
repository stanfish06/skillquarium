# msa-structure-prediction-pipeline

> [!info] What it does
> Run a complete protein structure prediction pipeline using NVIDIA BioNeMo NIMs: search for MSA alignments with MSA-Search (ColabFold), then predict the structure with OpenFold3 using the retrieved alignments. Use this skill whenever the user wants to predict a protein structure with maximum accuracy using MSA context, run the full AlphaFold3-style pipeline, generate MSA-informed structure predictions, or improve structure prediction accuracy by providing evolutionary information. Triggers on: MSA structure prediction pipeline, structure prediction pipeline, MSA-informed prediction, OpenFold3, ColabFold MSA, AlphaFold3 pipeline, protein structure, homology search, a3m alignment, UniRef30, NIM microservice. This pipeline chains MSA-Search and OpenFold3.
