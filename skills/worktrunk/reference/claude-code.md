# Agent Integration

Worktrunk ships a plugin for each supported agent CLI. What a plugin provides depends on the hooks that CLI exposes:

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Pi | oh-my-pi | Gemini CLI |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Configuration skill | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| Activity tracking (🤖/💬 in `wt list`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Worktree isolation | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |
| `/wt-switch-create` skill | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |

The configuration skill is documentation the agent reads to help set up LLM commits, hooks, and troubleshooting. Activity tracking shows which worktrees have running sessions. Worktree isolation needs worktree-lifecycle hooks, which only Claude Code exposes, so Codex, OpenCode, Pi, oh-my-pi, and Gemini users invoke `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` directly. Codex tracks activity through its own `Stop` and `SessionEnd` hooks.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
wt config plugins claude install
```

Manual equivalent:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk
claude plugin install worktrunk@worktrunk
```

`wt config plugins claude uninstall` removes the plugin and its marketplace entry.

### Codex

```bash
wt config plugins codex install
```

Manual equivalent:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk
codex plugin add worktrunk@worktrunk
```

`wt config plugins codex uninstall` removes the plugin and its marketplace entry.

### OpenCode

```bash
wt config plugins opencode install
```

This writes the activity-tracking plugin to OpenCode's global plugins directory, `~/.config/opencode/plugins/worktrunk.ts` (honoring `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). `wt config plugins opencode uninstall` removes it.

### Pi

```bash
wt config plugins pi install
```

This writes the activity extension to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/worktrunk.ts`, where Pi discovers it on startup; `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` replaces the agent directory. `wt config plugins pi uninstall` removes the extension.

### oh-my-pi

```bash
wt config plugins omp install
```

oh-my-pi (`omp`) is a Pi-derived agent with its own config root and hook API, so it takes a separate command. This writes the activity hook to `~/.omp/agent/hooks/pre/worktrunk.ts`. Named `$OMP_PROFILE` or `$PI_PROFILE` profiles use `~/.omp/profiles/<profile>/agent`, `$PI_CONFIG_DIR` changes the `.omp` config root, and `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` overrides the agent directory for the default profile. `wt config plugins omp uninstall` removes the hook.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk
```

Gemini loads the extension natively from the repository, so there is no `wt` wrapper. `gemini extensions uninstall worktrunk` removes it.

## Configuration skill

With the `/worktrunk` skill, the agent can help with:

- Setting up LLM-generated commit messages
- Adding project hooks (pre-start, pre-merge, pre-commit)
- Configuring worktree path templates
- Fixing shell integration issues

Claude Code is designed to load the skill automatically when it detects worktrunk-related questions.

## Activity tracking

Every plugin tracks agent sessions with status markers in `wt list`:

```console
$ wt list
  Branch       Status      HEAD±     main↕    main…±    Remote⇅  Commit    Age  Message
@ main             ^⇡                                    ⇡1      33323bc    1d  Initial commit
+ feature-api      ↑ 🤖              ↑1        +1                70343f0    1d  Add REST API endpo…

```

- 🤖 — agent is working
- 💬 — agent is waiting or idle

Every plugin clears the marker when a session ends. A stale marker can remain if the agent process is killed before its session-end hook runs. In every case, `wt config state marker clear` removes a marker manually.

### Manual status markers

Set status markers manually for any workflow:

```console
$ wt config state marker set "🚧"                   # Current branch
$ wt config state marker set "✅" --branch feature  # Specific branch
$ git config worktrunk.state.feature.marker '{"marker":"💬","set_at":0}'  # Direct
```

### Agent CLIs without a plugin

Activity tracking is not plugin-specific. The plugins above only call `wt` on their host's session events, and the marker itself is plain git config — so any CLI that can run a command on session lifecycle events drives the same 🤖/💬 markers with no worktrunk plugin:

| Host event | Command |
|---|---|
| Session starts, or the agent resumes work | `wt config state marker set "🤖"` |
| Agent finishes a turn and waits for input | `wt config state marker set "💬"` |
| Session ends | `wt config state marker clear` |

## Worktree isolation (Claude Code only)

Claude Code agents can run in isolated worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`). By default, Claude Code creates these with `git worktree add`. The plugin's `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hooks route this through `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` instead, so worktrees created by agents get worktrunk's naming conventions, hooks, and lifecycle management.

## `/wt-switch-create` skill (Claude Code only)

`/wt-switch-create [<branch>] [<repo>] [-- <task>]` starts a task in a fresh worktree without leaving the session: it creates the worktree, switches into it, and runs the task (all arguments optional). The worktree shows up in `wt list`; merge or remove it with `wt merge` / `wt remove`.

Claude Code asks for confirmation before a session enters an existing worktree by path outside `.claude/worktrees/`, which in worktrunk's default layout is every worktree. The plugin's `PermissionRequest` hook answers yes for a worktree of the repository the session is working in that sits where `worktree-path` puts its branch, so a background session doesn't stop at that prompt. Entering any other worktree still asks.

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

`wt list statusline --format=claude-code` outputs a single-line status for the Claude Code statusline. Claude Code runs it in the background, which is what makes the occasional 1–2 second CI fetch invisible.

<code>~/w/myproject.feature-auth  !🤖  @<span style='color:#0a0'>+42</span> <span style='color:#a00'>-8</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>↑3</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>⇡1</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>#3035</span>  Opus  🌔 65%  <span style='color:#a70'>1.4×(10am–3pm)</span></code>

Worktree state comes from the same cells [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/) renders; Claude Code's stdin JSON adds the model, the `🌔 65%` context gauge, and the rate-limit pace notice. [`wt list statusline`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#wt-list-statusline) documents every segment, how the links behave, and the JSON fields behind them.

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json title="~/.claude/settings.json"
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "wt list statusline --format=claude-code"
  }
}
```
