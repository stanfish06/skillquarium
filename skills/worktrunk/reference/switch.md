# wt switch

Switch to a worktree; create if needed.

Worktrees are addressed by branch name; paths are computed from a configurable template. Unlike `git switch`, this navigates between worktrees rather than changing branches in place.

## Examples

```console
$ wt switch feature-auth           # Switch to worktree
$ wt switch -                      # Previous worktree (like cd -)
$ wt switch --create new-feature   # Create new branch and worktree
$ wt switch --create hotfix --base production
$ wt switch pr:123                 # Switch to PR #123's branch
$ wt switch https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123   # ...or paste the PR's URL
```

## Creating a branch

The `--create` flag creates a new branch from `--base` — the default branch unless specified. Without `--create`, the branch must already exist. Switching to a remote branch (e.g., `wt switch feature` when only `origin/feature` exists) creates a local tracking branch.

A new branch tracks the remote branch it starts from only when the two share a name: `--create release --base origin/release` tracks `origin/release`, while `--create feature --base origin/release` gets no upstream. Publish such a branch with `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`, or set git's `push.autoSetupRemote = true` once.

## Creating worktrees

If the branch already has a worktree, `wt switch` changes directories to it. Otherwise, it creates one:

1. Runs [pre-switch hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types), blocking until complete
2. Creates worktree at configured path (or at `--path`)
3. Switches to new directory
4. Runs [pre-start hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types), blocking until complete
5. Spawns [post-start](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) and [post-switch hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/#hook-types) in the background

```console
$ wt switch feature                        # Existing branch → creates worktree
$ wt switch --create feature               # New branch and worktree
$ wt switch --create fix --base release    # New branch from release
$ wt switch --create temp --no-hooks       # Skip hooks
```

### Custom path [experimental]

`--path` places one worktree outside the `worktree-path` template, keeping the branch name intact:

```console
$ wt switch --create feature/JIRA-1234 --path ../dark-mode
$ wt switch ../dark-mode                   # Switch by path...
$ wt switch feature/JIRA-1234              # ...or by branch
```

Worktrunk finds the worktree from git's own records, so commands reach it by branch or path as usual. [`wt list`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/#worktree) marks it `⚐`, since it isn't at the path its branch implies, and [`wt step relocate`](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-relocate) offers to move it back to the template path.

## Naming a worktree

Worktrees are addressed by branch name, and every argument that takes one also accepts the path of the worktree itself — resolved after the branch, so a directory never shadows a branch sharing its name. A path names what a branch cannot: a detached worktree, or one of two checkouts of the same branch. Relative paths resolve against `-C` and a leading `~` against the home directory, so a path worktrunk printed can be pasted back.

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `^` | Default branch (`main`/`master`) |
| `@` | Current branch/worktree |
| `-` | Previous worktree (like `cd -`) |
| `pr:{N}` | GitHub PR #N's branch |
| `mr:{N}` | GitLab MR !N's branch |

```console
$ wt switch -                           # Back to previous
$ wt switch ^                           # Default branch worktree
$ wt switch --create fix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD
$ wt switch --create fix --base=pr:123  # Branch from PR #123's head
$ wt switch pr:123                      # PR #123's branch
$ wt switch mr:101                      # MR !101's branch
```

Shortcuts also apply to `--base`.

## Interactive picker

When called without arguments, `wt switch` opens an interactive picker to browse and select worktrees with live preview. The candidate set widens with `--branches` (local branches without worktrees), `--remotes` (remote branches), and `--prs` (open PRs/MRs — see below).

The CI column shows each row's PR/MR CI and review status, the same as [`wt list --full`](https://worktrunk.dev/list/).

**Keybindings:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` | Navigate worktree list |
| (type) | Filter worktrees |
| `Enter` | Switch to selected worktree |
| `Alt-c` | Create new worktree named as entered text |
| `Alt-x` | Remove selected worktree/branch (never forces; not the current worktree) |
| `Alt-y` | Copy selected branch name to the clipboard |
| `Alt-o` | Open the selected row's PR/MR URL in the browser |
| `Alt-r` | Refresh the list (pick up worktrees created elsewhere) |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
| `Alt-1`–`Alt-8` | Jump to a preview tab |
| `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` | Cycle available preview tabs forward/backward |
| `Alt-p` | Toggle preview panel |
| `Ctrl-u`/`Ctrl-d` | Scroll preview up/down |

The filter matches each row's branch, path, and — when it has a PR/MR — the PR/MR's number, title, and author. Typing `+` narrows to linked worktrees, and `@` to the current worktree.

**Preview tabs:**

1. **diff** — One net diff from the comparison base through the current worktree: committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked changes
2. **working** — Staged, unstaged, and untracked changes against `HEAD`
3. **committed** — Committed changes since the comparison base
4. **log** — Recent commits; commits already on the default branch have dimmed hashes
5. **remote⇅** — Ahead/behind diff vs upstream tracking branch
6. **summary** — LLM-generated branch summary; requires `[list] summary = true` and [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit)
7. **pr** — The selected row's PR/MR, for any row whose branch has one
8. **comments** — The PR/MR's comment thread, fetched from the forge for any row whose branch has one

The comparison base is the merge-base with the default branch, or with its upstream when the local default branch lags. The picker opens on **diff** for local rows and **pr** for a PR/MR listed by `--prs` but not available locally. A tab with no content for the selected row has a dimmed label, and the active tab's label is underlined. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` skip the dimmed tabs; `Alt-1` through `Alt-8` open any tab directly. After you choose a tab, that choice stays active while you navigate.

**Pager configuration:** The preview panel pipes diff output through git's pager. Override in user config:

```toml
# ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml
[switch.picker]
pager = "delta --paging=never --width=$COLUMNS"
```

## Pull requests and merge requests

The `pr:<number>` / `mr:<number>` shortcut and the PR/MR's web URL both resolve to its branch. For same-repo PRs/MRs, worktrunk switches to the branch directly. For fork PRs/MRs, it fetches the ref (`refs/pull/N/head` or `refs/merge-requests/N/head`) and configures `pushRemote` to the fork URL.

```console
$ wt switch pr:101                                  # GitHub PR #101
$ wt switch https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/101  # ...the same PR, by URL
$ wt switch mr:101                                  # GitLab MR !101
$ wt switch https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/merge_requests/101  # ...the same MR, by URL
$ wt switch --prs                                   # Browse open PRs/MRs in the picker
```

Both work anywhere a branch is accepted, including `--base`. The `--create` flag cannot be used with a PR/MR reference since the branch already exists.

If the PR or MR is on a fork, the local branch uses its branch name directly, so `git push` works normally. A pre-existing local branch with that name tracking something else requires renaming first.

The `--prs` flag adds the repository's open PRs (GitHub) or MRs (GitLab) that aren't already in the interactive picker. Selecting one switches to it as `pr:<number>` / `mr:<number>` would.

Requires `gh` (GitHub), `glab` (GitLab), or an equivalent CLI installed and authenticated; see [forge platform](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#forge-platform) for Gitea, Azure DevOps, and other supported platforms.

## When wt switch fails

- **Branch doesn't exist** — Use `--create`, or check `wt list --branches`
- **Path occupied** — Another worktree is at the target path; switch to it or remove it
- **Stale directory** — Use `--clobber` to remove a non-worktree directory at the target path

To change which branch a worktree is on, use `git switch` inside that worktree.

## Command reference

```
wt switch - Switch to a worktree; create if needed

Usage: wt switch [OPTIONS] [BRANCH] [-- <EXECUTE_ARGS>...]

Arguments:
  [BRANCH]
          Branch, worktree path, shortcut, or PR/MR URL

          Opens interactive picker if omitted. Shortcuts: ^ (default branch), - (previous), @
          (current), pr:{N} (GitHub PR), mr:{N} (GitLab MR)

  [EXECUTE_ARGS]...
          Additional arguments for --execute command (after --)

          Each argument is expanded for templates and passed directly to the program.

Options:
  -c, --create
          Create a new branch

  -b, --base <BASE>
          Base branch

          Defaults to default branch. Supports the same shortcuts as the branch argument: ^, @, -,
          pr:{N}, mr:{N}.

      --path <PATH>
          Worktree directory for a new worktree [experimental]

          Overrides the worktree-path template for this worktree. Relative paths resolve from the
          current directory, as with git worktree add. The branch keeps its own name; afterwards,
          switch by branch or by path.

  -x, --execute <EXECUTE>
          Program to run after switch

          Runs one external program after switching, with full terminal control. Arguments after --
          go directly to that program without Worktrunk shell parsing. Program lookup and argument
          decoding follow the operating system. Shell syntax requires an explicit shell, for example
          -x sh -- -c 'npm install && npm test'. On Windows, shell shims need their extension (-x
          code.cmd) or an explicit shell such as -x cmd.exe -- /C code.

          Without a branch argument, the interactive picker opens and the command runs against the
          selected worktree — so wt switch -x claude picks a worktree, then launches Claude Code
          there.

          The program starts in the worktree the switch selected, whether or not your shell follows
          it there: --no-cd governs only the shell.

          Supports hook template variables ({{ branch }}, {{ worktree_path }}, etc.) and filters. {{
          base }} and {{ base_worktree_path }} describe the source: the selected base with --create,
          or the invoking worktree when switching to an existing worktree.

          A variable inside a shell body is substituted before that shell parses it, so a path with
          spaces splits into several arguments. Pass it as a separate argument instead — sh binds
          the first one to $0, so the path arrives as $1:

            wt switch feature -x sh -- -c 'cd "$1" && npm test' sh '{{ worktree_path }}'

          Especially useful with shell aliases:

            alias wsc='wt switch --create -x claude'
            wsc feature-branch -- 'Fix GH #322'

          Then wsc feature-branch creates the worktree and launches Claude Code. Arguments after --
          are passed to the command, so wsc feature -- 'Fix GH #322' runs claude 'Fix GH #322',
          starting Claude with a prompt.

          Template example: -x code -- '{{ worktree_path }}' opens VS Code at the worktree, -x tmux
          -- new -s '{{ branch | sanitize }}' starts a tmux session named after the branch.

      --clobber
          Remove stale paths at target

      --no-cd
          Skip directory change after switching

          Hooks still run normally, and an --execute program still starts in the worktree — only
          your shell stays put, so wt switch feature --no-cd -x code -- . opens the worktree in an
          editor and leaves your terminal where it was. Useful when hooks handle navigation (e.g.,
          tmux workflows) or for CI/automation. Use --cd to override.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Picker Options:
      --branches
          Include branches without worktrees

      --remotes
          Include remote branches

      --prs
          Include open PRs/MRs

Automation:
      --no-hooks
          Skip hooks

      --format <FORMAT>
          Output format

          JSON prints structured result to stdout. Designed for tool integration (e.g., Claude Code
          WorktreeCreate hooks).

          [default: text]
          [possible values: text, json]

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

      --config-set <toml>
          Override config with inline TOML, e.g. --config-set list.full=true (repeatable)

  -v, --verbose...
          Verbose output (-v: info logs + hook/alias template variables on stderr; -vv: also debug
          logs and raw subprocess output written to .git/wt/logs/). Set WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2 to
          apply the same level everywhere — including shell completion, which no flag can reach

  -y, --yes
          Skip approval prompts
```
