# complexa-setup

> [!info] What it does
> First-time setup, environment configuration, and model-weight installation for Proteina-Complexa. Reach for this skill whenever the user says "set up complexa", "install complexa", "configure my environment file", "first-time setup", "what models do I have installed", "what's in my environment file", "download model weights", "download Complexa / AF2 / RF3 / ProteinMPNN / LigandMPNN / ESM2 / ESMFold checkpoints", "preflight my GPU", "verify environment", "complexa init", "complexa download", "complexa download --status", "complexa validate env", or any time a fresh checkout needs to be made runnable. This is the first skill to run on a new clone — it drives `complexa init`, `complexa download`, and `complexa validate env` end-to-end, edits the required `.env` keys, picks the right runtime (UV vs Docker), and emits a replayable setup artifact.
