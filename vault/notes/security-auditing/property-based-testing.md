# property-based-testing

> [!info] What it does
> Writes, reviews, and debugs property-based tests — Hypothesis, fast-check, proptest, jqwik, rapid, and Echidna or Medusa for Solidity invariants. Use whenever tests should cover a whole input domain instead of a hand-picked list of examples: encode/decode and serialize/deserialize pairs, parsers, canonicalizers and normalizers, validators, numeric and Decimal types, comparators and sort order, data structures, and smart-contract state invariants. Also use when adding cases to an existing @given, fast-check, or proptest suite, when judging whether existing property tests assert anything real, and when a generator has shrunk a counterexample and you need to tell a wrong property from a genuine bug. Not for coverage-guided binary fuzzing (libFuzzer, AFL), mutation-testing campaigns, static analysis, benchmarking, or end-to-end UI tests.
