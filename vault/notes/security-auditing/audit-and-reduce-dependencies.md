# audit-and-reduce-dependencies

> [!info] What it does
> Reduces JavaScript dependency footprint with pnpm while preserving lockfile, workspace layout, and dependency range style. Runs /check-npm first, then removes unused deps, dedupes versions, ranks transitive closure, and reports Keep/Replace/Remove triage. Use when cleaning up pnpm dependencies, reducing lockfile size, or shrinking node_modules in Grafana plugins; not for Go modules or full GitHub Actions workflow audits.
