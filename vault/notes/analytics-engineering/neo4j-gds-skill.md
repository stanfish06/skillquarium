# neo4j-gds-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) embedded plugin via Python client or Cypher — covers graphdatascience client 2.x, GraphDataScience, gds.graph.project.native, gds.graph.project.cypher, snake_case endpoints, graph catalog operations, stream/stats/mutate/write modes, memory estimation, PageRank, Louvain, WCC, FastRP, KNN, Node Similarity, ML pipelines, and cleanup. Use for Aura Pro, self-managed, local, or offline Neo4j DBMS with the GDS plugin installed. Does NOT cover Aura Graph Analytics GDS Sessions, AuraGraphDataScience, GdsSessions, gds.graph.project.remote, or AuraDB Cypher API projection/session management — use neo4j-aura-graph-analytics-skill. Does NOT handle Cypher authoring — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT cover driver setup — use neo4j-driver-python-skill or other driver skill.
