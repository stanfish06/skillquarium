# databricks-ml-training

> [!info] What it does
> Train ML models on Databricks. Use for: classification/regression/deep-learning (XGBoost, scikit-learn, LightGBM, PyTorch) with Optuna, @prod/@challenger aliases, batch scoring (spark_udf for plain models, fe.score_batch for feature-store-backed), custom PyFunc, custom ResponsesAgent (LangGraph + UC Function/Vector Search); UC feature tables + FeatureLookup + point-in-time joins + Lakebase online store; declarative Feature Views (create_feature, DeltaTableSource, RollingWindow/SlidingWindow/TumblingWindow, materialize_features, streaming Kafka features). NOT for: endpoint ops (databricks-model-serving), MLflow evaluation (databricks-mlflow-evaluation).
