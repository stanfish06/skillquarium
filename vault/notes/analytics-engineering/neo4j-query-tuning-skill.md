# neo4j-query-tuning-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Diagnoses and fixes slow Neo4j Cypher queries by reading execution plans, identifying bad operators (AllNodesScan, CartesianProduct, Eager, NodeByLabelScan), and prescribing fixes (indexes, hints, query rewrites, runtime selection). Use when a query is slow, when EXPLAIN or PROFILE output needs interpretation, when dbHits or pageCacheHitRatio are poor, when cardinality estimation diverges from actuals, or when deciding between slotted/pipelined/parallel runtimes. Covers USING INDEX / USING SCAN / USING JOIN hints, db.stats.retrieve, SHOW QUERIES, SHOW TRANSACTIONS, TERMINATE TRANSACTION. Does NOT write new Cypher from scratch — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT cover GDS algorithm tuning — use neo4j-gds-skill. Does NOT cover index/constraint creation syntax details — use neo4j-cypher-skill references/indexes.md.
