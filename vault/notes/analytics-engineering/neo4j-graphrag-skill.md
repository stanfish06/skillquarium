# neo4j-graphrag-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Build GraphRAG retrieval pipelines on Neo4j using the neo4j-graphrag Python package (v1.16.0+). Covers retriever selection (VectorRetriever, HybridRetriever, VectorCypherRetriever, HybridCypherRetriever, Text2CypherRetriever, ToolsRetriever), external vector DB retrievers (Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant), retrieval_query Cypher fragments, query_params, filters, GraphRAG pipeline wiring (GraphRAG + LLM + prompt), all LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, VertexAI, Bedrock, Cohere, Mistral, Ollama), embedder setup, index creation, token usage tracking, Cypher 25 SEARCH clause, and LangChain/LlamaIndex integration. Does NOT handle KG construction — use neo4j-document-import-skill. Does NOT handle plain vector search — use neo4j-vector-index-skill. Does NOT handle GDS analytics — use neo4j-gds-skill. Does NOT handle agent memory — use neo4j-agent-memory-skill.
