# neo4j-aura-provisioning-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Provisions and manages Neo4j Aura instances via CLI (aura-cli v1.7+) or REST API. Use when creating, pausing, resuming, resizing, or deleting AuraDB Free/Professional/Business Critical/VDC instances; downloading credentials; scripting CI/CD pipelines; polling async status; or using the Terraform neo4j-labs/neo4jaura provider. Covers auth setup (client credentials OAuth2), credential lifecycle (download once — never recoverable), instance type selection, region codes, and Python provisioning scripts. Does NOT handle Cypher queries — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT cover Graph Data Science algorithms — use neo4j-gds-skill or neo4j-aura-graph-analytics-skill. Does NOT cover neo4j-admin/cypher-shell — use neo4j-cli-tools-skill.
