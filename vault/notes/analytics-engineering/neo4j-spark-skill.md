# neo4j-spark-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Use when reading from or writing to Neo4j with Apache Spark or Databricks using the Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark 6.0 (org.neo4j.connectors:spark) or 5.x (org.neo4j:neo4j-connector-apache-spark). Covers SparkSession setup, DataFrame reads via labels/Cypher/relationship scan, DataFrame writes with SaveMode, node.keys for MERGE, relationship write mapping, partition and batch tuning, PySpark and Scala examples, Databricks cluster config, Databricks secrets for credentials, Delta Lake to Neo4j pipelines. Does NOT handle Cypher authoring — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT handle the Python bolt driver — use neo4j-driver-python-skill. Does NOT handle GDS algorithms — use neo4j-gds-skill.
