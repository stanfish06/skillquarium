# neo4j-kafka-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Configure and operate the Neo4j Connector for Kafka (sink + source) and the native Neo4j CDC API. Covers Cypher/Pattern/CUD sink strategies, CDC-based and query-based source, exactly-once semantics, DLQ error handling, Confluent Cloud managed connector, schema registry (Avro/JSON), and native db.cdc.query cursor-loop patterns (Neo4j 5.13+ Enterprise/Aura BC/VDC). Use when streaming Kafka events into Neo4j, streaming Neo4j changes to Kafka, or querying Neo4j change events without Kafka. Does NOT handle Cypher query authoring — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT handle bulk CSV/file import — use neo4j-import-skill. Does NOT handle GDS algorithms — use neo4j-gds-skill.
