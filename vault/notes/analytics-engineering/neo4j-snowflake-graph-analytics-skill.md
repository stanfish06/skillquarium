# neo4j-snowflake-graph-analytics-skill

> [!info] What it does
> Run Neo4j Graph Analytics algorithms (PageRank, Louvain, WCC, Dijkstra, KNN, Node2Vec, FastRP, GraphSAGE) directly inside Snowflake without moving data. Use when running graph algorithms against Snowflake tables via the Neo4j Snowflake Native App ("GDS Snowflake", "graph algorithms in Snowflake", "Neo4j Graph Analytics"). Covers the explore → prepare projection views → project-compute-write flow, the strict view/column type rules the graph engine requires, exact SQL CALL syntax, and privilege setup in both modes — app-identity grants and execute-as-user / per-user PAT auth (programmatic access token, set_enable_custom_credentials, register_user_role, caller grants). Does NOT cover Cypher or Neo4j DBMS queries — use neo4j-cypher-skill. Does NOT cover Aura Graph Analytics — use neo4j-aura-graph-analytics-skill. Does NOT cover self-managed GDS — use neo4j-gds-skill.
