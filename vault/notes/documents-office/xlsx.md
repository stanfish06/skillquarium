> [!note] Vault audit 2026-07-24 — USE-1
> Use this as the raw-OOXML fallback — low-level .xlsx/.csv inspection and data extraction; for authoring formatted workbooks, models, or dashboards use the canonical `officecli-xlsx` (scene layers: `officecli-financial-model`, `officecli-data-dashboard`). Distinguishing axis: raw spreadsheet processing vs officecli workbook generation.

> The "Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics" block in the source skill (hardcoded `scripts/generate_schematic.py` path) is copy-pasted across docx/pptx/xlsx/pdf and can drift; for schematic/diagram generation cross-reference the `scientific-schematics` skill rather than relying on the duplicated block.
