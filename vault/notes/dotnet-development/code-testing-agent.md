# code-testing-agent

> [!info] What it does
> Generates and writes new unit tests for any programming language — scaffolds test projects and configures coverage tooling (coverlet, pytest-cov, @vitest/coverage-v8) as part of test generation. Use when asked to generate tests, generate pytest tests, generate Vitest tests, write unit tests, add tests, improve coverage, comprehensive tests, or scaffold a new test project or suite for an app, service, library, REST API, blueprint, or package — including project-wide, multi-file test generation across services, repositories, routes, and modules. Supports C#/.NET, Python (pytest, Flask/Django), TypeScript/JavaScript (Vitest, Jest, Mocha), Go, Rust, Java (JUnit). Runs a research, planning, and implementation pipeline so tests compile and pass. DO NOT USE FOR: running existing tests (use run-tests); analyzing existing coverage reports (use coverage-analysis or crap-score); writing, fixing, or modernizing MSTest-specific tests, assertions, attributes, or lifecycle (use writing-mstest-tests).

## Notes

> [!note] Vault audit 2026-07-24 — USE-19
> Use this to generate new tests in any language (C#/.NET, Python, TS/JS, Go, Rust, Java); it is filed under the .NET map but is not .NET-specific — for MSTest-specific authoring/modernization use `writing-mstest-tests`. Distinguishing axis: polyglot test generation vs .NET-only authoring.
