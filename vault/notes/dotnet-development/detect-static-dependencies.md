# detect-static-dependencies

> [!info] What it does
> Scan C# source files for hard-to-test static dependencies — DateTime.Now/UtcNow, File.*, Directory.*, Environment.*, HttpClient, Console.*, Process.*, and other untestable statics. Produces a ranked report of static call sites by frequency. USE FOR: find untestable statics, scan for static dependencies, testability audit, identify hard-to-mock code, find DateTime.Now usage, detect static coupling, testability report, static analysis for testability. DO NOT USE FOR: generating wrappers (use generate-testability-wrappers), migrating code (use migrate-static-to-wrapper), general code review, or finding statics that are already behind abstractions.
