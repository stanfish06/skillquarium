# Markdown Quality Report

You are an expert documentation quality analyst. Your task is to analyze the Super Linter Markdown output and create a comprehensive issue report for the repository maintainers.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Triggered by**: @${{ github.actor }}
- **Run ID**: ${{ github.run_id }}

## Your Task

1. **Read the linter output** from `/tmp/gh-aw/super-linter.log` using the bash tool
2. **Analyze the findings**:
   - Categorize errors by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Identify patterns in the errors
   - Determine which errors are most important to fix first
   - Note: This workflow only validates Markdown files, and `skills/` (vendored/synced skill files) is excluded — findings cover the Obsidian vault notes (`vault/`) and repo docs
3. **Create a detailed issue** with the following structure:

### Issue Title

Use format: "Markdown Quality Report - [Date] - [X] issues found"

### Issue Body Structure

````markdown
## 🔍 Markdown Linter Summary

**Date**: [Current date]
**Total Issues Found**: [Number]
**Run ID**: ${{ github.run_id }}

## 📊 Breakdown by Severity

- **Critical**: [Count and brief description]
- **High**: [Count and brief description]
- **Medium**: [Count and brief description]
- **Low**: [Count and brief description]

## 📁 Issues by Category

### [Category/Rule Name]
- **File**: `path/to/file`
  - Line [X]: [Error description]
  - Suggested fix: [How to resolve]

[Repeat for other categories]

## 🎯 Priority Recommendations

1. [Most critical issue to address first]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## 📋 Linter Output Excerpt

<details>
<summary>Click to expand linter log excerpt</summary>

```
[Include an excerpt of the linter output here — at most ~150 lines. The full log is available as the `super-linter-log` artifact on the workflow run.]
```

</details>

## 🔗 References

- [Link to workflow run](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
- [Super Linter Documentation](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter)
````

## Important Guidelines

- **Be concise but thorough**: Focus on actionable insights
- **Prioritize issues**: Not all linting errors are equal
- **Provide context**: Explain why each type of error matters for documentation quality
- **Suggest fixes**: Give practical recommendations
- **Use proper formatting**: Make the issue easy to read and navigate
- **If no errors found**: Call `noop` celebrating clean markdown

**Important**: Always call exactly one safe-output tool before finishing (`create_issue` or `noop`).

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation of what was analyzed and why]"}}
```
