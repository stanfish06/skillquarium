# crap-score

> [!info] What it does
> Calculates targeted CRAP (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) scores for a named .NET method, class, or single source file. Use when the user explicitly asks to compute CRAP scores or assess risky untested code for a specific target, combining Cobertura coverage data with cyclomatic complexity analysis. DO NOT USE FOR: project-wide coverage analysis, coverage plateau or "stuck coverage" diagnosis, what's blocking coverage, or where to add tests across a project (use coverage-analysis); writing tests; running tests without CRAP context.

## Notes

> [!warning] Vault audit 2026-07-24 — MNT-11
> Its DO-NOT-USE-FOR redirect sends project-wide coverage to the generic `coverage-analysis`; for .NET projects route to `dotnet-coverage-analysis` instead.
> _Remote-managed skill — the durable fix belongs upstream; this wrapper note is the local record._
