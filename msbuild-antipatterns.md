# msbuild-antipatterns

> [!info] What it does
> Detect and fix MSBuild anti-patterns in project and build files. USE WHEN asked to review, audit, lint, clean up, or code-review a .csproj/.vbproj/.fsproj/.props/.targets/.proj (or Directory.Build.props/.targets) file, when asked 'is this project file correct?' or 'what's wrong with my build file?', or when hunting subtle build bugs caused by how a project is authored. Each anti-pattern has a symptom and a concrete BAD→GOOD fix. DO NOT USE FOR: non-MSBuild build systems (npm, Maven, CMake), or migrating a project to SDK-style (use msbuild-modernization).
