# test-smell-detection

> [!info] What it does
> Deep-dive audit using the full testsmells.org 19-smell academic catalog for tests in any language. Every finding maps to a named, citable smell from the research literature (Assertion Roulette, Duplicate Assert, Mystery Guest, Eager Test, Sensitive Equality, Conditional Test Logic, Sleepy Test, Magic Number Test, etc.) with research-backed severity. Polyglot: .NET (MSTest/xUnit/NUnit/TUnit), Python (pytest/unittest), TS/JS (Jest/Vitest/Mocha/node:test), Java (JUnit/TestNG), Go, Ruby (RSpec/Minitest), Rust, Swift, Kotlin (JUnit/Kotest), PowerShell (Pester), C++ (GoogleTest/Catch2). INVOKE ONLY when explicitly asked for the testsmells.org 19-smell academic catalog or citable smell names from the literature. DO NOT USE FOR: general or pragmatic audits — use test-anti-patterns; writing new tests (use code-testing-agent, or writing-mstest-tests for MSTest); running tests (use run-tests); framework migration.
